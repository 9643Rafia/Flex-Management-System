# Flex-Management-System

# INTRODUCTION
The Flex Management System, developed in C++ with a robust adherence to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, serves as a dynamic portal for educational institutions. Students benefit from an intuitive interface allowing real-time access to marks, attendance, and grades, while teachers efficiently utilize encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to upload and manage academic records. The system's OOP design ensures modularity, reusability, and extensibility, providing a streamlined and maintainable solution for comprehensive educational management.
